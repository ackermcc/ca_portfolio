              <p class="large-copy">I am currently an Interaction Designer at GE in San Ramon, CA. I chose the <i>Wait Staff Review</i> prompt because I am excited about this problem space and familiar with the pain points of being a server.</p>

              <p class="large-copy">I decided to begin by searching the internet for any resources I could find on server reviews and restaurant management applications. I found that more than a few current solutions already existed as well as a rather entertaining blog with testimonials of current server's pain points.</p>

								<ul>

										Test low fidelity solutions (MVPs) with end users based on those learning objectives.

											<li>Are we using the right attributes to test a service experience? Can we add these attributes to the bottom of receipts at a restaurant, collect and present feedback to servers and their managers?</li>

									<li>Identify and prioritize pain points and use cases to inform a product roadmap and implementation plan.</li>
									<li>Dive into detailed user flows and wireframes to create an interaction model and find exceptions.</li>
