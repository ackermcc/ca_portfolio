		    <p>NiteLife was founded on the desire to have a better experience finding where to go out at night. <b>Dave Johnson, Matt Regnold, Britney Bogard (my fellow co-founders)</b> and myself could not find an existing solution that fulfilled our needs, so we created one.</p>

		    <p class="caption">NiteLife was origninally NiteLifeCam, with the concept of installing cameras inside of venues so that users could see what the crowd was like before going out. This was our teaser video we used to guage interest and collect early adopters' emails.</p>

		    <p>We couldn’t find a product that gave bar and club owners the opportunity to directly market and connect with their customers, or give consumers an on-the-go solution that provided them the information they actually cared about. The team went through many iterations when we first started talking about NiteLife: putting cameras inside of bars to let the users know what the crowd was like, hailing a cab through the app (sound familiar?), providing happy hour information by neighborhoods and many more.</p>

		    <p class="caption">Everyday in class, at the gym or out at bars we were sketching ideas about what we wanted to NiteLife to be and how we could improve.</p>

		    <p>The first version of NiteLife was a simple web application with the ability to view venues and their happy hour specials nearby. We went from a web application to a full iOS application within 8 months while the two main developers were on opposite coasts interning. Overtime we added features based on user feedback and added two members to our team, the Hoop siblings, to help us with marketing, design and copy writing.</p>

		    <p class="caption">This day alone we had over 100 downloads, needless to say, was considerably more than our previous single day high.</p>

		    <p>We pursued many different marketing campaigns including social media marketing, promotional videos, ‘free’ download cards and partnerships with local venues for events. Ultimately, our biggest successes in marketing was a tweet from the President of the University of Cincinnati who is extremely popular with the students on social media. President Ono’s tweet not only gave us a huge spike in downloads, but also an <a href="http://www.soapboxmedia.com/innovationnews/012114-new-nitelife-app-makes-cincinnati-bar-hopping-cheaper-and-easier.aspx">interview with a local Cincinnati blog</a>. Tools like Hootsuite and advertising platforms through Facebook and Twitter enabled us to easily reach our target market with little to no advertising experience.</p>

		    <p>By the time NiteLife shut down we had over 1,000 downloads and active users in the Cincinnati area. Shortly after graduation we decided to close up shop and pursue other career opportunities. A lot of mistakes were made as we built our first business, but the amount we learned from the experience was more than worth the effort. Some things I would do differently if I had the chance:
		      <ul>
		        <li><b>Test more often.</b> Due to our time constraints we weren’t able to move as quickly as we would have liked. Testing concepts and designs with end users would have allowed us to make decisions and build features more quickly.</li>
		        <li><b>Utilize existing platforms (Google, Yelp, Foursquare).</b> We followed the “nail it before you scale it” mantra, but possibly to a fault. All of NiteLife’s data was manually added by us, which was limited to information online or who would answer our phone calls.</li>
