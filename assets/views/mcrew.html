		    <p>Rail yards are large and fast paced operations that can be difficult to manage. Hundreds of railcars come in and out every day carrying various cargo from coal to iPhones and even vehicles. In order to maximize efficiency of operations accurate locations and placements of each railcar is extremely important.</p>

		    <p>GPS and RFID railcar tracking is expensive and easily damaged or tampered with, so railcars can be tracked manually. To help maintain an accurate railcar inventory mCrew was designed to help yard workers manage and report work. mCrew is a multi-platoform logistics mobile application that can report train and rail car movements real time, in and out of network coverage.</p>

		    <p class="pull-quote">mCrew is a multi-platoform logistics mobile application that can report train and rail car movements real time, in and out of network coverage.</p>

		    <p>mCrew had some unique challenges due to rail yard locations and the work processes of their current users. Veteran rail yard workers enjoyed paper work orders during the day and entering their work on industrial windows tablets at the end of the shift, which has repercussions on data latency in the system. The previous solution was physically clunky and cumbersome to use, making it difficult to manage on the go. Rail yards are often  outdoors with low internet connectivity, adding levels of complexity for usability in different weather conditions and offline syncing.</p>

		    <p>mCrew 2.0 was redesigned for iPad mini with a new information architecture and visual design to improve usability. Offline sync was implemented to improve collecting and updating work in locations with low connectivity. We designed multiple iterations to test outside in high sunlight and tried multiple rugged cases and styluses for users in colder weather wearing gloves. Some things I would do differently if I had the chance:
		      <ul>
		        <li><b>More diverse usability testing.</b> We were only able to do one round of testing which made it difficult to get feedback on our solution in the varying environments.</li>
		        <li><b>Try different form factors.</b> I joined the project when most of the research was complete and the decision to build an iOS application had been made. I would have liked the opportunity to try different form factors including different mobile devices and voice based interactions.</li>
		      </ul>
