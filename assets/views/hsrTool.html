		    <p>The GE Global Research Center (GRC) funded a project through GE Digital to build a web based prototype for proof of concept. This was my first project at GE and possibly the freakin' coolest things I have ever worked on due to its domain and the technology we were using.</p>

		    <p>There are constant advances in medical technology that improve imaging, performance and overall patient satisfaction. No matter how advanced medical technology has become, there remain constraints in the environment they are installed and operated in. Most large medical equipment utilizes a considerable amount of energy and thus produces a significant amount of heat. In order for these machines to operate efficiently their temperature must be managed without compromising patient comfort.</p>

		    <p>Initial site research was performed by the GRC, conducting user interviews to understand pain points of installing and operating GE scanners. Once we understood the science behind the concept we conducted our own interviews and created storyboards for the prototype. Utilizing modern web technologies including three.js and Web Workers we completed a prototype that allowed users to interact, visualize and run the solution.</p>
