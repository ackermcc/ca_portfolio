				<p>The railroad industry historically is considered “behind the times” when it comes to software and technology. One of the major railroads asked GE to help bring their automotive shipment operation into the 21st century to cut down on operation costs, improve efficiency and decrease missed shipments.</p>

				<p class="caption">8 inch lase up steel toed boots are required for visiting most railyard sites. Safety is the most important rule at any indistrial site, which you will be reminded of nearly every step of the way.</p>

				<p>We asked our client to come to San Ramon with some of their end users for a kickoff workout. Our team facilitated an entire day of value stream mapping where we broke down their current process into major buckets under which we identified the humans, tools or systems and pain points. After the initial work out we strapped on our boots (literally) and went to visit their largest and smallest sites, seeing 4 in total. We interviewed end users in various roles and continued to build upon our value stream map.</p>

				<p>Once the research was complete we synthesized what we learned and created concept storyboards for the future of automotive shipment on rail. The final deliverables were a journey map, conceptual proposals and a schedule for work in the future months.</p>
